problems with EPN_to_PGN
------------------------


//4. need to select what is promoted - and add this to epntogpn i.e. d1=Q



New Important Things...

// fix up list box for games in separate panel class, remove functions from main frame into panel class

new windows
a) variation board -- class in place
b) folder window     -- class in place (use 2nd listBoxPanel)
c) databases window   -- class in place ( use 2nd listboxpanel)
e) cp graph window    -- class in place
f) tree view window	
g) annotation in separate viewport window -- class in place ... simple text control
h) clocks window


new panels for the day
//a) Promotion Selection    -- class in place
	//done: button 4 = knight
	  //    button 1 = Queen
	   //   button 2 = rook
	    //  button 3 = bishop

	      
//b) Engine Load / Save popups  -- class in place for load/save
c) Setup Position panel    -- class in place
d) Load Engine / selection engine from list   --class in place
//e) Save file dialog     
f) New Game dialog (maybe)
//g) Set Game Info dialog       -- class in place
	//done, can edit the header
	-- needs Add Element dialog.
	-- modify date (can't set as string as restrictions apply)
	-- modify result


h) Themes dialog              -- class in place

i) options dialog  - will use a settings dialog
j) help dialog
k) about dialog
l) engine options
m) wizard for batch analaysis mode



Other features...
a) code folding
b) cp graph				-- class in place
c) set position from Fen		
d) render to rendergraph for notation		-- I can't even remember what I was thinking about here
e) analysis tab, toolbar, batch analysis, monte-carlo etc		
f) implement aui manager switching for the program			
g) game information printed to the top of the play window		
h) need delete variation					
i) insert nodes for analysis
j) detect stalemate in loaded pgn files
k) always promote to Queen mode




Bugs
----

enumerate variations bugs

possibly some extra white space on pgns saved to disk
might want to handle dollar symbols at some stage
percent symbol -- low priority since it is mainly unused

graphics -- need to show game data above notation
graphics -- need to have the notation text remove the curly braces
graphics -- faster text window -- virtual window calculated and redraw only replaces the last selected and next selected



//need to add correct handling of !! symbols

//IMPORTANT:: PGNLoad is failing on double comments of the form
//1.e4 {[comment]}{[comment 2.16]} 
//I think this is simply the need to detect the '{' and push through to the next loop some how.
// This was finally solved by doing the simply job of writing a better tokenizer


bug on variations added to root ... somehow overwrites sometimes

//fixed: bug on focus from variation window in mdi

// added bitmaps buttons for analysis window
// added multi-pv mode switching
	todo - improvements
//		add 1 string for each pv, to keep the window output stable
		add more features
//		get gameplay mode working
//		do analysis for player making moves
//		browse through moves	



//- scroll to 0,0 on LoadPGN 

//IMPORTANT: Need to set different Aui manager layouts when tab is clicked.
 

//problem with ... whitevariation-blackvariation ... its put as another mainline
// SOLVED at least for black variations

bug on load PGN from FEN (again)

//Engine is working.
//current problems ...
//beautify the window
//multiple sets of pv's can be displayed ... one string per pv
//text at the top of the window


//NEW...
//Check detection is bad, need to look for checkmate instead and return checks
// FIXED: The detection problem stems again from the bCaptured flag ... needed to make sure 




//Want "NEW GAME" this means multiple PGN loads, 


-- maybe
if a pgn is loaded, then create a new session
if nothing is loaded, then create an additional game in the current session



list of filenames stored for each sessions
save temporary files
huge database viewport

CLOCKS!
// imported LCD window
possible ICC connection?
//parse engine Kibitz output
Load Multiple Engines
Use wxStopWatch

IMPORTANT TASKS ...
-------------------
1) Spawn Multiple Boards
2) Create/refresh new game
//3) Undo action (e.g. delete)  --not really needed
//4) Redo action

Ideas (maybes)
--------------
temporay data directory, for files saved during play ... i.e. load game, edit game, select other game, go back to previous game (and fens are gone, so the data is regenerated but the variations are messed up if added to the end)



stack of instructions
---------------------
e.g. 
instruction   id      data1    at pos in tree
-----------------------------------------------
makemove     num     e2e4      14. variation Nd5 16. whites move


means insert e2e4 in move 14 variation Nd5 at move 16 for whites move


created move stack contains meta data, the moves are remade if undone

deleted subtree stack...
-----------------------
if a variation is deleted perhaps the entire subtree should be stored in a type of stack.
the deleted subtree is simply cut from the tree and stored in a stack

instruction    id     at move     isVariation     move        color
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
deleteSubTree  num       15       true             Nbd7       black

subtree stack contains

deleted items
-------------
15 ... Nbd7
3...f4


etc
then Nbd7 and completed subtree can be inserted into a variation of black for move 15.
